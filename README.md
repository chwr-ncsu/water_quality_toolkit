Requirements:
-	This toolkit was built in MATLABÂ® Version R2017a. using the GUIDE interface builder in MATLAB
- The (.m) and (.fig) files were compiled as a windwows application (.exe)
- The (.exe) application uses the RunRcode.f to run the WRTDS model in R Studio
- The working directory for the .R code is set to the directory of the downloadeded 
  .exe file (e.g. C:/Program Files/TAP_CRM).  If you wish to run the code in another directory 
  the working directory should be changed in the .R code named "tap_crm_wrtds_model.R".
  -NOTE: Make sure the application has permission to write files to the direcotry in Program Files.
